# Convrrt 
(or Convrsion whatever is the more hipster way of writing/naming your app)

## Soooo what does it do?!
I'm glad you asked! It uh...basically just converts videos!

## What?! You made this from scratch!?
LMAOOOO....no. I use FFMPEG to handle the heavy lifting, I basically just wrapped some of it's functions in Electron. Neat eh?

## What other technologies are you using?
Another great question, I'm using ye ol React and a little Redux...I will admit, I totally had a lot of help with the redux!...sigh okay and some help with React itself but not alot! I swear most of it was me not realizing small things that I should know! T_T
